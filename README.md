### Implicit-Explicit methods for Reaction-Diffusion Equations

This repository implements several implicit-explicit finite difference schemes for reaction-diffusion equations, as described in Ruuth. Results for the numerical simulations in the paper are reproduced for the 1-dimensional Schnakenberg equations. Slides for a presentation on this project can be found [here](https://github.com/ahccheung/imex/blob/master/final_presentation.pdf).
